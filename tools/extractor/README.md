# Extractor

Maintainer tool. Reads a build's paks with [CUE4Parse](https://github.com/FabianFG/CUE4Parse) and writes the shared
game data in `gamedata/`, which is committed so users never run this.

```
dotnet run -c Release --project tools/extractor -- "<build folder with FortniteGame and Engine>" <aes key>
```

Item template ids are resolved with the build's own asset manager rules (`PrimaryAssetTypesToScan` in
`DefaultGame.ini`).
